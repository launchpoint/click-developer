`developer` is like a mini kernel for site development.

`developer` and any plugins will not load unless the site is in development mode.

When active, `developer` places a button on every web page. The button opens a dashboard that provides easy access to common resources and debugging information.

`developer` is also extended by other modules such as [w3cvalidation](?doc=w3cvalidation) and [doc_reader](?doc=doc_reader).
